This file explains all of the variables in each of the datasets that accompany: Sánchez-Clavijo, L.M., 
Bayly, N.J., and Quintana-Ascencio, P.F. Habitat selection in transformed landscapes and the role of 
forest remnants and shade coffee in the conservation of resident birds. Journal of Animal Ecology. 
Accepted August 2019.

Data has been derived from two main sources: 

1) Project “Crossing the Caribbean: Identifying critical fuelling sites for Neotropical migratory birds in 
northern Colombia” (April 2009 – present) carried out by SELVA - Research for Conservation in the 
Neotropics, and funded by the Rufford Small Grants Foundation, Environment and Climate Change 
Canada and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.

ecosystems for native species persistence" (2016). Electronic Theses and Dissertations. 5240.
